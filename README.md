# BitsandBobs

A small repo designed to store exactly as the title suggests, random bits and bobs of example code, solutions and ideas.

This is a safe playzone for exploring new concepts like regular expressions or timer functions.

If you happen upon this repo while scouring the intermawebs feel free to jump in, copy and paste, have a read, sacrifice your first born or trade your soul for a better one.

Anything is possible in BitsandBobs.
